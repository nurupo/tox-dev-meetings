# Topics for the meeting:
1. PGC development state
2. IRC sync bot vs IRC gateway [tox-user]
3. Packaging [sudden6]
4. Tox client standard [tox-user]

# Meeting summary:
1. PGC is still as broken as a week ago.
2. We don't know of any benefits of IRC gateway over an IRC sync bot at the moment.
3. We need to look into what GNU/Linux distributions are missing toxcore packages and think about creating them.
4. We will force developers of official clients to comply with TCS and create a table about which clients comply. Clients that don't follow the guidelines will eventually be removed from tox.chat website.
